# Improving Python Project Packaging

This document outlines the current state of the art for Python dependency management and packaging tooling, and aims to propose a set of changes to current and future Python projects to improve the development experience and make it easier to develop and publish Python packages.


## Abstract

Python packaging and practices for managing development environments have changed significantly over the past few years. Modern developments such as `pyproject.toml`, and more advanced dependency resolvers, virtual environment, building, and publising tooling allows for a more streamlined and unified development experience. To achieve this, a number of tools are evaluated and compared, and a set of recommendations are proposed for the future of our Python project packaging and dependency management.



## Packaging Tools

Packaging Python projects and managing virtual environments has become a lot easier in recent years if you know what you're doing, but if you don't, it just looks like a sea of tools doing a lot of the same things. This section aims to clarify the differences between the various tools and how they fit together.

The most popular tools are looked at in turn to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and how they can be used together. 
<!-- NOTE: Together to do what? -->
