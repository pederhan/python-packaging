# Specialized Tools

The tools in this category perform a subset of the Python packaging and development process, but not all of it. They are often used in conjunction with other tools (and indeed each other) to achieve a complete workflow.

This means they should be able to perform one or more of the following tasks:

- Virtual Environment management
- Dependency resolution
- Locking/pinning
- Building
- Reproducible builds
- Publishing

And optionally:

- Supports `pyproject.toml`
- PEP 621 compliant
